In this article we will use OpenSSL create client certificate along with server certificate which we will use for encrypted communication for our Apache webserver using HTTPS. These client and server certificates will be signed using CA key and CA certificate bundle which we have created in our previous article.

I have already written multiple articles on OpenSSL, I would recommend you to also check them for more overview on openssl examples:

Lab Environment
I have 3 Virtual Machines in my environment which are installed with CentOS 8 running on Oracle VirtualBox. It is important that you use proper hostname or IP Address in the Common Name section while generate Certificate Signing Request or else the SSL encryption between server and client with fail.

Below are the details of my servers on which I will create client certificate along with other certificates for complete validation.

Node1	Node2	Node3
Hostname	centos8-1	centos8-2	centos8-3
FQDN	centos8-1.example.com	centos8-2.example.com	centos8-3.example.com
IP Address	10.10.10.12	10.10.10.16	10.10.10.17
Purpose	Create CA and server client certificates	Client using which we will connect to Apache server	Server where Apache service will be running
 

Install OpenSSL
On RHEL/CentOS 7/8 you can use yum or dnf respectively while on Ubuntu use apt-get to install openssl rpm

NOTE:
On RHEL system you must have an active subscription to RHN or you can configure a local offline repository using which "yum" package manager can install the provided rpm and it's dependencies.
bash

[root@centos8-1 ~]# yum -y install openssl
 

OpenSSL create client certificate
Let us first create client certificate using openssl.

 

Create client private key
To create client certificate we will first create client private key using openssl command. In this example we are creating client key client.key.pem with 4096 bit size.

HINT:
We are not using any encryption with openssl to create client private key to avoid any passphrase prompt. but you can choose to use -des3 or any other encryption in the below command
bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# openssl genrsa -out client.key.pem 4096
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus (2 primes)

Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using client Key
Next we will use our client key to generate certificate signing request (CSR) client.csr using openssl command.

bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# openssl req -new -key client.key.pem -out client.csr
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:IN
State or Province Name (full name) []:Karnataka
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:bengaluru
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:GoLinuxCloud

Email Address []:admin@golinuxcloud.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request

Configure openssl x509 extensions for client certificate
It is important to define openssl x509 extensions to be used to create client certificate. You can read more about these extensions at the man page of openssl x509.

bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# cat client_cert_ext.cnf
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = client, email
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Client Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer
keyUsage = critical, nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth, emailProtection
Here,

bash

basicConstraints      : An end user certificate must either set CA to FALSE or exclude the extension entirely
nsCertType            : This is Netscape Certificate Type which consists of a list of flags to be included. 
                        Acceptable values for nsCertType are: client, server, email, objsign, reserved, sslCA, emailCA, objCA
nsComment             : Netscape Comment (nsComment) is a string extension containing a comment which will be displayed 
                        when the certificate is viewed in some browsers.
subjectKeyIdentifier  : This is really a string extension and can take two possible values. Either the word hash which will 
                        automatically follow the guidelines in RFC3280 or a hex string giving the extension value to include.
authorityKeyIdentifier: The authority key identifier extension permits two options. keyid and issuer: both can take the optional value "always".
keyUsage              : Key usage is a multi valued extension consisting of a list of names of the permitted key usages.
extendedKeyUsage      : This extensions consists of a list of usages indicating purposes for which the certificate public key can be used for,

Create client certificate
Next using openssl x509 will issue our client certificate and sign it using the CA key and CA certificate chain which we had created in our previous article.
If you do not have CA certificate chain bundle then you can also create your own CA certificate and then use that CA to sign your client certificate.
This client certificate will be valid for 365 days and will be encrypted with sha256 algorithm
Since our CA key is encrypted with passphrase, I have provided the passphrase file to avoid any password prompt on the screen which we had created earlier.
Use -extfile to define the x509 extensions which we will use to create client certificate. Alternatively you could have also used openssl.cnf and just provide -extensions argument with the key value used in openssl.cnf
This command will create client certificate client.cert.pem
bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA /root/tls/intermediate/certs/ca-chain-bundle.cert.pem -CAkey /root/tls/intermediate/private/intermediate.cakey.pem -out client.cert.pem -CAcreateserial -days 365 -sha256 -extfile client_cert_ext.cnf
Signature ok
subject=C = IN, ST = Karnataka, L = bengaluru, O = GoLinuxCloud, OU = R&D, CN = centos8-2, emailAddress = admin@golinuxcloud.com
Getting CA Private Key
 

Openssl verify client certificate content
In this section we have created below files:

client.key.pem   ⇒ Client private key
client.csr           ⇒ Client CSR
client.cert.pem  ⇒ Client Certificate
ALSO READ:
Shell script to generate certificate OpenSSL [No Prompts]
You can use below commands to verify the content of these certificates:

bash

# openssl rsa -noout -text -in client.key.pem
# openssl req -noout -text -in client.csr
# openssl x509 -noout -text -in client.cert.pem
 

OpenSSL create server certificate
Next we will create server certificate using openssl.

 

Create server private key
To create server certificate we will first create server private key using openssl command. In this example we are creating server key server.key.pem with 4096 bit size.

HINT:
We are not using any encryption with openssl to create server private key to avoid any passphrase prompt. but you can choose to use -des3 or any other encryption in the below command
bash

....++++
.......................++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
 

Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using Server Key
Next we will use our server key server.key.pem to generate certificate signing request (CSR) server.csr using openssl command.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
It is very important that you provide the hostname or IP address value of your server node with Common Name or else the server client TCP handshake will fail if the hostname does not matches the CN of the server certificate. Our server hostname is centos8-3 as you can check under Lab Environment.
bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# openssl req -new -key server.key.pem -out server.csr
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,

Configure openssl x509 extensions for server certificate
It is again important to define openssl x509 extensions to be used to create server certificate. These extensions value will differentiate between your server and client certificate. You can read more about these extensions at the man page of openssl x509.

bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# cat server_cert_ext.cnf
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = server
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer:always
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
You can compare these values with what we defined under our client certificate extensions

 

Create server certificate
We will use similar command as used to create client certificate, openssl x509 to create server certificate and sign it using our server.csr which we created above.
We will use CA certificate (certificate bundle) and CA key from our previous article to issue and sign the certificate
The server certificate will be valid for 365 days and encrypted with sha256 algorithm
Define the absolute path and filename of the configuration file which contains openssl x509 extensions for your server certificate using -extfile. If you are using default openssl.cnf then you can also create an extensions section in your openssl.cnf and use -extensions with the key value from openssl.cnf to define your extensions.
The subject in the output contains our CSR details which we provided with server.csr
This command will create server certificate server.cert.pem
bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA /root/tls/intermediate/certs/ca-chain-bundle.cert.pem -CAkey /root/tls/intermediate/private/intermediate.cakey.pem -out server.cert.pem -CAcreateserial -days 365 -sha256 -extfile server_cert_ext.cnf

Openssl verify server certificate content
In this section we have created below files:

server.key.pem   ⇒ Server private key
server.csr           ⇒ Server CSR
server.cert.pem  ⇒ Server Certificate
You can use below commands to verify the content of these certificates:

bash

# openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key.pem
# openssl req -noout -text -in server.csr
# openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.cert.pem
 

Configure Apache with SSL (HTTPS)
I will not go much into the detail steps to configure Apache with HTTPS as that in not our primary agenda of this article. I will configure a basic webserver to use Port 8443 on centos8-3

 

Install Apache Package
To setup HTTPS apache server we need to install httpd and mod_ssl. In RHEL/CentoS 8 the default package manager is DNF instead of traditional YUM

bash

[root@centos8-3 ~]# dnf -y install httpd mod_ssl
 

Arrange all the server certificates for client authentication
I have created a new directory certs under /etc/httpd/conf.d where I will store all the server certificates and the same path is provided in our httpd.cond

bash

[root@centos8-3 certs]# mkdir /etc/httpd/conf.d/certs
Copy server certificates to the server node i.e. centos8-3. We are using scp to copy files from one server to another but you can choose any other tool to transfer the certificates securely over the network.

bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# scp server.key.pem server.cert.pem /root/tls/intermediate/certs/ca-chain-bundle.cert.pem  centos8-3:/etc/httpd/conf.d/certs/
root@centos8-3's password:
server.key.pem                                                                                    100% 3243     3.8MB/s   00:00
server.cert.pem                                                                                   100% 2484     2.7MB/s   00:00
ca-chain-bundle.cert.pem                                                                          100% 4240     5.9MB/s   00:00
 

Change Port Number of Apache Server
Since we plan to use a custom port 8443 to verify our server client authentication and TCP handshake, we will change the Listen value from 80 to 8443 in httpd.conf

bash

[root@centos8-3 ~]# vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Listen 8443

Configure Apache Virtual Hosting
I have added below virtual hosting content at the end of "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf". You can read more about Apache Virtual Hosting in another article.

bash

<VirtualHost *:8443>
   SSLEngine On
   SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/conf.d/certs/server.cert.pem
   SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/httpd/conf.d/certs/ca-chain-bundle.cert.pem
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/conf.d/certs/server.key.pem
   ServerAdmin root@centos8-3.example.com
   DocumentRoot /var/www/html
   ServerName centos8-3.example.com
   ErrorLog logs/centos8-3.example.com-error_log
   CustomLog logs/centos8-3.example.com-access_log common
</VirtualHost>
 

For more list of supported options follow man page of mod_ssl.

Here,

bash

SSLEngine               : This section is used to enable SSL/TLS for a that virtual host.
SSLCertificateFile      : This directive points to a file with certificate data in PEM format
SSLCertificateChainFile : This directive sets the optional all-in-one file where you can assemble 
                          the certificates of Certification Authorities (CA) which form the certificate
                          chain of the server certificate
SSLCertificateKeyFile   : This directive points to the PEM-encoded private key file for the server
HINT:
If you do not have certificate chain file then instead of using SSLCertificateChainFile, you can choose SSLCACertificateFile which was used to sign the client certificates.
 

Restart Apache service
To activate the changes we must restart the httpd services and then you can use netstat or any other tool to check the list of listening ports in Linux.

bash

[root@centos8-3 ~]# systemctl restart httpd
As you see port 8443 is in LISTEN state so our changes are activated.

bash

[root@centos8-3 ~]# netstat -ntlp | grep 8443
tcp6       0      0 :::8443                 :::*                    LISTEN      5602/httpd
HINT:
I have stopped firewalld service (systemctl stop firewalld) and disabled SELinux for the verification on my server centos8-3 node.
 

Verify TCP Handshake using Client Server Certificates
First let us try to connect our Apache webserver without providing any client certificates using curl command and verbose output.

HINT:
If curl command is not available then you can install curl using "dnf install curl" on your client node.
bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# curl  https://centos8-3:8443 -v

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
As expected we are getting Failed TCP handshake error and our client was unable to connect to the web server.

Next let us try to connect to our web server using the client certificates. Use --key to define the client key file, --cert to define the client certificate and --cacert to define the CA certificate we used to sign the certificates followed by the web server address.

bash

[root@centos8-1 certs]# curl --key client.key.pem  --cert client.cert.pem --cacert /root/tls/intermediate/certs/ca-chain-bundle.cert.pem  https://centos8-3:8443 -v

This is the reason I had stressed on the point to make sure you give proper Common Name for server when you create server certificate. The provided Common Name will be used to match the server request and further authentication.

Now it also possible that you would like to reach your web server using other CNAME or IP Addresses so in such case you will end up creating multiple server certificates or to avoid this we can create SAN certificates.

 

We will learn more about SAN certificates in the next article

 

Lastly I hope the steps from the article to create client certificate and create server certificate using openssl to establish an encrypted communication between server and client on Linux was helpful. So, let me know your suggestions and feedback using the comment section.
